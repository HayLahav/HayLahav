👋 Hi, I’m @HayLahav
Welcome to my profile!
Here's a short background about myself, check it out 👇🏻



I am a B.Sc. graduate in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Tel Aviv University. 

Final degree project: "Electronic stabilization of images and videos by smartphone\laptop sensors and video processing algorithms". 📷

I am primarily interested in the following fields:

* AI and signal algorithms (such as Deep Learning, Computer Vision, image and video processing)
 I am mainly interested in camera and sensing technologies, for example in the field of autonomous 
 vehicles.

* Chip design and verification (front end)
 I am interested in the hardware domain with a preference for the field of AI processors
Important course taken (grades):
python (86) | C programming (88) | VLSI (91) | image processing lab (96) | Digital logic systems (89) | Digital circuits (82) | Computer Vision (87)

I have academic experience (projects, assignments and theoretical knowledge) in AI: Computer Vision, Machine learning, Deep learning and image processing. Some of the projects I've worked on: Facial Manipulation Detection, MNIST digit classification using neural networks, Stereo matching, Building a panorama image.

My final VLSI design project was defining and planning a 4 bit ALU design (Virtuoso)

During my studies, I developed my Verilog coding skills by completing two small projects using Xilinx Vivado software: FPGA countdown, FPGA IO interfaces. 

In addition, I completed the following programs/ self-learning courses:
• IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate (v2)
• Self-Driving Cars specialization - University of Toronto – Coursera
• Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization - DeepLearning.AI
 
Programming skills:
* Knowledge and experience with C, Matlab and Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, OpenCV)
* Experience in the following DL frameworks: Keras, TensorFlow and Pytorch 
* Experience with Linux (Ubuntu open source operating system) 
*  C++ and Verilog (intermediate skills)
 
 

 I am a self and fast learner, curious, work well in a team, and highly motivated to start my first job in the high-tech industry.
